\section{Interval trees}
\label{sec:interval-trees}

In certain geometric applications like planar graphs, we might be interested in reporting all line segments associated with a window query  $w = [x_0, x_1] \times [y_0, y_1]$. We can report all line segments inside $w$ using algorithms and techniques from Section
